(claim)#such evaluation requires gold standard data in an intermediate representation .
(claim)#however , it has been argued that the conversion of parsing results into an intermediate representation is difficult and far from perfect .
(claim)#the relationship between parsing accuracy and task accuracy has been obscure for many years .
0.2#(quirk and corston oliver 2006)#$1 investigated the impact of parsing accuracy on statistical mt .
(claim)#however , this work was only concerned with a single dependency parser , and did not focus on parsers based on different frameworks .
