interpreting comparative constructions in biomedical text .
abstract .
we propose a methodology using underspecified semantic interpretation to process comparative constructions in medline citations , concentrating on two structures that are prevalent in the research literature reporting on clinical trials for drug therapies .
the method exploits an existing semantic processor , semrep , which constructs predications based on the unified medical language system .
results of a preliminary evaluation were recall of 70 % , precision of 96 % , and f-score of 81 % .
we discuss the generalization of the methodology to other entities such as therapeutic and diagnostic procedures .
the available structures in computable format are potentially useful for interpreting outcome statements in medline citations .
introduction .
as natural language processing ( nlp ) is increasingly able to support advanced information management techniques for research in medicine and biology , it is being incrementally improved to provide extended coverage and more accurate results .
in this paper , we discuss the extension of an existing semantic interpretation system to address comparative structures .
these structures provide a way of explicating the characteristics of one entity in terms of a second , thereby enhancing the description of the first .
this phenomenon is important in clinical research literature reporting the results of clinical trials .
in the abstracts of these reports , a treatment for some disease is typically discussed using two types of comparative structures .
the first announces that the ( primary ) therapy focused on in the study will be compared to some other ( secondary ) therapy .
a typical example is ( 1 ) . effective than ranitidine in patients with endoscopically confirmed non-erosive reflux esophagitis .
the processing of comparative expressions such as ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) was incorporated into an existing system , semrep [ rindflesch and fiszman , 2003 ; rindflesch et al. , 2005 ] , which constructs semantic predications by mapping assertions in biomedical text to the unified medical language system � ( umls ) � [ humphreys et al. , 1998 ] .
background .
comparative structures in english .
the range of comparative expressions in english is extensive and complex .
several linguistic studies have investigated their characteristics , with differing assumptions about syntax and semantics ( for example [ ryan , 1981 ; rayner and banks , 1990 ; staab and hahn , 1997 ; huddleston and pullum , 2002 ] ) .
our study concentrates on structures in which two drugs are compared with respect to a shared attribute ( e.g. how well they treat some disease ) .
an assessment of their relative merit in this regard is indicated by their positions on a scale .
the compared terms are expressed as noun phrases , which can be considered to be conjoined .
the shared characteristic focused on is expressed as a predicate outside the comparative structure .
an adjective or noun is used to denote the scale , and words such as than , as , with , and to serve as cues to identify the compared terms , the scale , and the relative position of the terms on the scale .
the first type of structure we address ( called comp1 and illustrated in ( 3 ) ) merely asserts that the primary and secondary terms ( in bold ) are being compared .
a possible cue for identifying these structures is a form of compare .
a further characteristic is that the compared terms are separated by a conjunction , or a preposition , as in ( 3 ) .
in the more complex comparative expression we accommodate ( called comp2 ) , the relative ranking of two compared terms is indicated on a scale denoted by an adjective ( e.g. effective in ( 5 ) ) .
the relative position of the compared terms in scalar comparative structures of this type expresses either equality or inequality .
inequality is further divided into superiority , where the primary compared term is higher on the scale than the secondary , and inferiority , where the opposite is true .
cues associated with the adjective designating the scale signal these phenomena ( e.g. as adj as in ( 5 ) for equality , adjer than in ( 6 ) for superiority , and less adj than in ( 7 ) for inferiority ) .
few studies describe an implemented automatic analysis of comparatives ; however , friedman [ friedman , 1989 ] is a notable exception .
jindal and liu [ jindal and liu , 2006 ] use machine learning to identify some comparative structures , but do not provide a semantic interpretation .
we exploit semrep machinery to interpret the aspects of comparative structures just described .
semrep .
semrep [ rindflesch and fiszman , 2003 ; rindflesch et al. , 2005 ] recovers underspecified semantic propositions in biomedical text based on a partial syntactic analysis and structured domain knowledge from the umls .
several systems that extract entities and relations are under development in both the clinical and molecular biology domains .
during semrep processing , a partial syntactic parse is produced that depends on lexical look-up in the specialist lexicon [ mccray et al. , 1994 ] and a part-of-speech tagger [ smith et al. , 2004 ] .
metamap [ aronson , 2001 ] then matches noun phrases to concepts in the metathesaurus � and determines the semantic type for each concept .
for example , the structure in ( 9 ) , produced for ( 8 ) , allows both syntactic and semantic information to be used in further semrep processing that interprets semantic predications .
predicates are derived from indicator rules that map syntactic phenomena ( such as verbs and nominalizations ) to relationships in the umls semantic network .
argument identification is guided by dependency grammar rules as well as constraints imposed by the semantic network .
in processing ( 8 ) , for example , an indicator rule links the nominalization treatment with the semantic network relation � pharmacologic substance treats disease or syndrome . � since the semantic types of the syntactic arguments identified for treatment in this sentence ( � pharmacologic substance � for � lansoprazole � and � disease or syndrome � for � gastroesophageal reflux disease � ) match the corresponding semantic types in the relation from the semantic network , the predication in ( 10 ) is constructed , where subject and object are metathesaurus concepts .
methods .
linguistic patterns .
we extracted sentences for developing comparative processing from a set of some 10,000 medline citations reporting on the results of clinical trials , a rich source of comparative structures .
in this sample , the most frequent patterns for comp1 ( only announces that two terms are compared ) and comp2 ( includes a scale and positions on that scale ) are given in ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) .
in the patterns , term1 and term2 refer to the primary and secondary compared terms , respectively . � { be } � means that some form of be is optional , and slash indicates disjunction .
these patterns served as guides for enhancing semrep argument identification machinery but were not implemented as such .
that is , they indicate necessary components but do not preclude intervening modifiers and qualifiers .
as with semrep in general , the interpretation of comparative structures exploits underspecified syntactic structure enhanced with metathesaurus concepts and semantic types .
semantic groups [ mccray et al. , 2001 ] from the semantic network are also available .
for this project , we exploit the group chemicals & drugs , which contains such semantic types as � pharmacologic substance � , � antibiotic � , and � immunologic factor � . ( the principles used here also apply to compared terms with semantic types from other semantic groups , such as � procedures � . )
in the comp1 patterns , a form of compare acts as an indicator of a comparative predication .
in comp2 , the adjective serves that function .
other words appearing in the patterns cue the indicator word ( in comp2 ) and help identify the compared terms ( in both comp1 and comp2 ) .
the conjunction versus is special in that it cues the secondary compared term ( term2 ) in comp1 , but may also indicate a comp1 structure in the absence of a form of compare ( c5 ) .
interpreting comp1 patterns .
when semrep encounters a form of compare , it assumes a comp1 structure and looks to the right for the first noun phrase immediately preceded by with , to , and , or versus .
if the head of this phrase is mapped to a concept having a semantic type in the group chemicals & drugs , it is marked as the secondary compared term .
the algorithm then looks to the left of that term for a noun phrase having a semantic type also in the group chemicals & drugs , which becomes the primary compared term .
when this processing is applied to ( 13 ) , the semantic predication ( 14 ) is produced , in which the predicate is compared _ with ; the first argument is the primary compared term and the other is the secondary .
as noted earlier , although a scale is sometimes asserted in these structures ( as in ( 13 ) ) , semrep does not retrieve it .
an assertion regarding position on the scale never appears in comp1 structures .
semrep treats compared terms as being coordinated .
for example , this identification allows both � lorazepam � and � dimenhydrinate � to function as arguments of treats in ( 15 ) .
consequently , in addition to ( 16 ) , the predications in ( 17 ) are returned as the semantic interpretation of ( 15 ) .
such processing is done for all comp1 and comp2 structures ( although these results are not given for ( 13 ) and are not further discussed in this paper ) .
interpreting comp2 patterns .
in addition to identifying two compared terms when processing comp2 patterns , a scale must be named and the relative position of the terms on that scale indicated .
the algorithm for finding compared terms in comp2 structures begins by locating one of the cues as , than , or to and then examines the next noun phrase to the right .
if its head has been mapped to a concept with a semantic type in the group chemicals & drugs , it is marked as the secondary compared term .
as in comp1 , the algorithm then looks to the left for the first noun phrase having a head in the same semantic group , and that phrase is marked as the primary compared term .
to find the scale name , semrep examines the secondary compared term and then locates the first adjective to its left .
the nominalization of that adjective ( as found in the specialist lexicon ) is designated as the scale and serves as an argument of the predicate scale in the interpretation .
for adjectives superior and inferior ( patterns s4 and s5 in ( 12 ) ) the scale name is � goodness . � in determining relative position on the scale , equality is contrasted with inequality .
if the adjective of the construction is immediately preceded by as ( pattern s1 in ( 12 ) above ) , the two compared terms have the same position on the scale ( equality ) , and are construed as arguments of a predication with predicate same _ as .
in all other comp2 constructions , the compared terms are in a relationship of inequality .
the primary compared term is considered higher on the scale unless the adjective is inferior or is preceded by less , in which case the secondary term is higher .
the predicates higher _ than and lower _ than are used to construct predications with the compared terms to interpret position on the scale .
the equality construction in ( 18 ) is expressed as the predications in ( 19 ) .
accommodating negation .
negation in comparative structures affects the position of the compared terms on the scale , and is accommodated differently for equality and for inequality .
when a scalar comparison of equality ( pattern s1 , as adj as ) is negated , the primary term is lower on the scale than the secondary ( rather than being at least equal ) .
for example , in interpreting the negated equality construction in ( 24 ) , semrep produces ( 25 ) .
to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed methods we created a test set of 300 sentences containing comparative structures .
these were extracted by the second author ( who did not participate in the development of the methodology ) from 3000 medline citations published later in date than the citations used to develop the methodology .
the citations were retrieved with a pubmed query specifying randomized controlled studies and comparative studies on drug therapy .
sentences containing direct comparisons of the pharmacological actions of two drugs expressed in the target structures ( comp1 and comp2 ) were extracted starting from the latest retrieved citation and continuing until 300 sentences with comparative structures had been examined .
these were annotated with the pubmed id of the citation , names of two drugs ( compared _ with predication ) , the scale on which they are compared ( scale ) , and the relative position of the primary drug with respect to the secondary ( same _ as , higher _ than , or lower _ than ) .
the test sentences were processed using semrep and evaluated against the annotated test set .
we then computed recall and precision in several ways : overall for all comparative structures , for comp1 structures only , and for comp2 structures only .
to understand how the overall identification of comparatives is influenced by the components of the construction , we also computed recall and precision separately for drug names , scale , and position on scale ( same _ as , higher than and lower than taken together ) .
recall measures the proportion of manually annotated categories that have been correctly identified automatically .
precision measures what proportion of the automatically annotated categories is correct .
in addition , the overall identification of comparative structures was evaluated using the f- measure [ rijsbergen , 1979 ] , which combines recall and precision .
the f-measure was computed using macro-averaging and micro-averaging .
macro- averaging was computed over each category first and then averaged over the three categories ( drug names , scale , and position on scale ) .
this approach gives equal weight to each category .
in micro- averaging ( which gives an equal weight to the performance on each sentence ) recall and precision were obtained by summing over all individual sentences .
because it is impossible to enumerate all entities and relations which are not drugs , scale , or position we did not use the classification error rate and other metrics that require computing of true negative values .
results .
upon inspection of the semrep processing results we noticed that the test set contained nine duplicates .
in addition , four sentences were not processed for various technical reasons .
we report the results for the remaining 287 sentences , which contain 288 comparative structures occurring in 168 medline citations .
seventy four citations contain 85 comp2 structures .
the remaining 203 structures are comp1 .
correct identification of comparative structures of both types depends on two factors : 1 ) recognition of both drugs being compared , and 2 ) recognition of the presence of a comparative structure itself .
in addition , correct identification of the comp2 structures depends on recognition of the scale on which the drugs are compared and the relative position of the drugs on the scale .
table 1 presents recall , precision , and f-score reflecting these factors .
we considered drug identification to be correct only if both drugs participating in the relationship were identified correctly .
the recall results indicate that approximately 30 % of the drugs and comparative structures of comp1 , as well as 40 % of comp2 structures , remain unrecognized ; however , all components are identified with high precision .
macro-averaging over compared drug names , scale , and position on scale categories we achieve an f-score = 0.78 .
the micro-average score for 287 comparative sentences is 0.5 . 5 discussion in examining semrep errors , we determined that more than 60 % of the false negatives ( for both comp1 and comp2 ) were due to � empty heads � [ chodorow et al. , 1985 ; guthrie et al. , 1990 ] , in which the syntactic head of a noun phrase does not reflect semantic thrust .
such heads prevent semrep from accurately determining the semantic type and group of the noun phrase .
in our sample , expressions interpreted as empty heads include those referring to drug dosage and formulations , such as extended release ( the latter often abbreviated as xr ) .
examples of missed interpretations are in sentences ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) , where the empty heads are in bold .
ahlers et al. [ ahlers et al. , 2007 ] discuss enhancements to semrep for accommodating empty heads .
these mechanisms are being incorporated into the processing for comparative structures .
false positives were due exclusively to word sense ambiguity .
for example , in ( 30 ) bid ( twice a day ) was mapped to the concept � bid protein � , which belongs to the semantic group chemicals & drugs .
the most recent version of metamap , which will soon be called by comparative processing , exploits word sense disambiguation [ humphrey et al. , 2006 ] and will likely resolve some of these errors .
although , in this paper , we tested the method on structures in which the compared terms belong to the semantic group chemicals & drugs , we can straightforwardly generalize the method by adding other semantic groups to the algorithm .
for example , if semrep recognized the noun phrases in bold in ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) as belonging to the group procedures , comparative processing could proceed as for chemicals & drugs .
the semantic predications returned by semrep to represent comparative expressions can be considered a type of executable knowledge that supports reasoning .
since the arguments in these predications have been mapped to the umls , a structured knowledge source , they can be manipulated using that knowledge .
it is also possible to compute the transitive closure of all semrep output for a collection of texts to determine which drug was asserted in that collection to be the best with respect to some characteristic .
this ability could be very useful in supporting question-answering applications .
as noted earlier , it is common in reporting on the results of randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews that a comp1 structure appears early in the discourse to announce the objectives of the study and that a comp2 structure often appears near the end to give the results .
another example of this phenomenon appears in ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) ( from pmid 15943841 ) .
we suggest one example of an application that can benefit from the information provided by the knowledge inherent in the semantic interpretation of comparative structures , and that is the interpretation of outcome statements in medline citations , as a method for supporting automatic access to the latest results from clinical trials research .
conclusion .
we expanded a symbolic semantic interpreter to identify comparative constructions in biomedical text .
the method relies on underspecified syntactic analysis and domain knowledge from the umls .
we identify two compared terms and scalar comparative structures in medline citations .
although we restricted the method to comparisons of drug therapies , the method can be easily generalized to other entities such as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures .
the availability of this information in computable format can support the identification of outcome sentences in medline , which in turn supports translation of biomedical research into improvements in quality of patient care .
